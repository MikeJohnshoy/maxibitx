// This filter's job is narrower than antialias.c's: by the time IQ
// reaches here (sound_process() applies antialias_apply() to every
// sample before this), content above ~47.5kHz is already suppressed
// by that filter's own ~-81dB stopband. This filter only needs to
// guard the "gap" between the new 24kHz Nyquist (once decimated to
// 48kHz) and where antialias.c's own rejection has already taken over
// - see the design doc for the full cascade reasoning and why that
// keeps this filter cheap despite a much narrower transition band
// (15kHz-24kHz here, vs. antialias.c's 32kHz-47.5kHz).
